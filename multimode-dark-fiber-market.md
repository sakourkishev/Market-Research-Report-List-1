<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-index Multimode Fiber</li><li>Graded-index Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multimode dark fiber market consists primarily of two types: step-index multimode fiber and graded-index multimode fiber. Step-index multimode fiber features a uniform refractive index profile, allowing light to be transmitted in multiple paths, but with higher modal dispersion. In contrast, graded-index multimode fiber has a varying refractive index that reduces modal dispersion, improving signal quality over longer distances. Both types are crucial for high-capacity data transmission in enterprise networks, data centers, and telecommunications.</p></p>
