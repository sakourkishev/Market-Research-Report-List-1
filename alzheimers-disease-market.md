<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer's Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donepezil</li><li>Memantine</li><li>Rivastigmine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's disease market features three primary drug types: Donepezil, Memantine, and Rivastigmine. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances cognitive function by increasing acetylcholine levels. Rivastigmine also belongs to this category, offering similar benefits but in both patch and oral forms. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, targets glutamate levels to mitigate symptoms and further slow cognitive decline. Together, these treatments aim to improve quality of life for patients, shaping a competitive market driven by ongoing research and advancements in therapy.</p></p>
