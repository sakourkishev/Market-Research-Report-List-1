<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-stage Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single-stage magnetic pump market includes two primary types: stationary shaft and rotating shaft designs. Stationary shaft magnetic pumps feature a fixed shaft with the impeller rotating externally, allowing for efficient magnetic coupling without direct contact, reducing wear. In contrast, rotating shaft magnetic pumps have a rotating element that directly engages with the outer magnets, providing a compact design but potentially increasing mechanical stress. Both types are utilized for their chemical resistance and ability to securely transport fluids without leaks, enhancing safety and efficiency in various applications.</p></p>
